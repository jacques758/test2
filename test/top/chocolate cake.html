	<h3>devil food cake but better</h3>
    <p>This pictured cake is a combination of chocolate buttercream and mock-devil food cake. </p>
    <p>You know the Devil Food chocolate cake you get at a restaurant or even from a box mix? This is that exact cake, only completely homemade</p>
    <p>The baking soda in this recipe reacts with the natural cocoa powder, which results in the reddish color.</p>

        <h4> chocolate cake ingrediens</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour: The structure of the cake. Do not use cake flour when combined with ultra-light cocoa powder, cake flour is too fine.</li>
            <li>Unsweetened Natural Cocoa Powder: Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Baking Soda & Baking Powder: We use both here for lift.</li>
            <li>Salt: Salt balances the flavor.</li>
            <li>Espresso Powder: Espresso powder is optional, but I recommend its addition because it enhances the chocolate flavor. The chocolate cake will not taste like coffee, I promise.</li>
            <li>Oil: Dont use butter in this cake batter. Cocoa powder is a particularly drying ingredient, so this cake needs oil for suitable moisture</li>
            <li>Eggs: Use 2 room temperature eggs. To speed up the gently warming, place refrigerated eggs in a cup of warm water for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Buttermilk: This chocolate cake requires the moisture and acidity from buttermilk. Lately I’ve been using a mix of sour cream and buttermilk, as well as reducing the hot liquid.</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract: Vanilla extract adds flavor.</li>
            <li>Hot Coffee or Hot Water: Hot liquid enhances the cocoa powder’s flavor. It also encourages it to bloom and dissolve appropriately.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>instruction</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
            <li>Make the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.</li>
            <li>Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.</li>
            <li>Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick.Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.</li>
            <li>Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.</li>
            <li>Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
